# 🧠 Mental Health and Data Science Initiative

This project uses machine learning and data science to enhance early detection, prediction, and intervention strategies for mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Predict the likelihood of mental health issues from multimodal data.
- Detect early warning signs using supervised and unsupervised ML.
- Analyze social media, wearables, and surveys.
- Recommend personalized interventions.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/`: Datasets (e.g., CSVs from surveys, social media, wearables)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `src/`: Core Python code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- `models/`: Saved trained models
- `README.md`: Documentation
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Techniques

- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks
- K-Means, DBSCAN for clustering
- BERT for NLP, CNN for facial emotion analysis
- LSTM for time series analysis from wearables

---

## 🔐 Ethics and Privacy

All data is anonymized and securely stored. The project prioritizes fairness, transparency, and explainability.

---

## 📈 Output

- Mental health risk level predictions
- Real-time emotion detection
- Trends and insights for policymakers
